# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in TypeScript

This repository contains an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) written in JavaScript. The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is completely isolated from the main blockchain, which makes Ethereum a perfect sandboxed environment.

## Overview

The application is designed to emulate the functionality of the EVM, providing a platform for executing Ethereum bytecode. This JavaScript version of the EVM allows developers to run and test their smart contracts in a JavaScript environment, offering a convenient way to debug and optimize their contracts. However, keep in mind that not all opcodes have been implemented yet.

## Features

- Supports most EVM operations: arithmetic, logical, cryptographic, control flow, etc.
- Transaction execution and state management.

## Usage

To use this EVM implementation, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine. Clone this repository, install the dependencies with `yarn install` and start the application.
